## Purpose
The purpose of this workshop is not to turn you into a computer scientist or an expert Python programmer. The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to basic syntax/commands of Python and to give you examples of how Python is used in different biological contexts. 

## Outline
## Cloning GitHub repository


## Installation (~ 15 minutes)
Please install Anaconda using the 'Installing_Anaconda_Python' tutorial in this repository



## Python is Awesome! (~5-10 minutes)
### What is Python?
"Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms."

### Pros & Cons
|Pros | Cons | 
|:-----|:----:|
|efficient high level data structures|speed limitations|
|support object oriented programming|issues with threading|
|simple syntax|Not native to mobile environment|
|versatile|high memory consumption|
|easy to use||
|fast to develop||
|Has a ton of libraries (Pandas, Numpy, BioPython etc. )||



### Where to get help on Python
- http://www.python.org
- Your BCB-GSO Tutorial! Or any other tutorial out there
- https://wiki/python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers
- Google! (This goes for anything in grad school. Google is your friend.) 

Not sure if I am good at programming of good at googling picture

### What could I use Python for?
- writing bioinformatic tools: give examples
- visualizing data
- processing data
- statistical modeling (BCB2)

## The Basics.... (first hour)
### How to run Python

1. Double click on the Anaconda Navigator that we just downloaded
2. Launch a new Jupyter Notebook
3. Navigate to the location where you cloned this tutorial
4. Open up 'TheBasics.ipynb'


### syntax & Basic Structure


### Arithmetic
### Strings
### Variables
define a variable; explain that this variable holds a value
### Lists
### Dictionaries
### Print



### basic exercises
1. Print the sequence alone (without header '6404|')
2. Print the sequence alone, all in lower-case
3. Print the index of substring 'GAAC' (first occurrence only)
4. Make it a RNA sequence and print it out (change every T to U)
5. Add 'CAGACACGC' to the end of the sequence and print it out


### Functions




## Example Bioinformatics task (2nd hour)



## Visualizations


## Numpy: kind of understand
## Pandas: Need to review
## Biopython: I know very little
